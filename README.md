# Expand Chord Symbols

This MuseScore 3 plugin finds all the chord symbols in the current score, then generates the corresponding notes into a staff.

The user can choose whether to generate
* all the notes for each chord, which could be 8 or 9 notes for a complex chord like E13add4#5, or
* a condensed chord containing only the 4 most harmonically important notes, plus a bass note, and inverted as needed 
so that most of the notes are near or below middle C. This "condensed" mode gives results almost identical
to Marc Sabatella's recommended voicings shown [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaca_EAmBCE&feature=youtu.be%0A) and [here](https://musescore.com/marcsabatella/chord-symbol-voicings-for-playback).
