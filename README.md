# Expand Chord Symbols

This MuseScore 3 plugin generates notes for all the chord symbols in the current score.

The user can choose whether to generate:
* all the notes in each chord, which could be 8 or 9 notes for a complex chord like C13, or
* a condensed chord containing only the 4 most harmonically important notes, plus a bass note, and inverted as needed 
so that most of the notes are near or below middle C. This "condensed" mode produces voicings that are almost identical
to Marc Sabatella's recommended voicings shown [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaca_EAmBCE&feature=youtu.be%0A) and [here](https://musescore.com/marcsabatella/chord-symbol-voicings-for-playback).

All generated notes are added to voice 1 of the last staff in the score. Any existing notes in that voice in that staff will be overwritten.
